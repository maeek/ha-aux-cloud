# ha-aux-cloud

(**Currently work in progress**)

Unofficial integration for Aux Cloud connected appliances like air conditioners and heat pumps. Aux Cloud is a service
based on the Broadlink platform that allows you to control your appliances from anywhere. This is a cloud alternative
to[replacing wifi module in your AC](https: // github.com / GrKoR / esphome_aux_ac_component), which will also allow you
to control heat pumps. The implementation of API requests are based on public resources from Broadlink documentation and
lots of reverse engineering.
