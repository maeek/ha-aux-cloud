# AUX Cloud Integration for Home Assistant

Unofficial integration for Aux Cloud connected appliances like air conditioners and heat pumps. Aux Cloud is a service
based on the Broadlink platform that allows you to control your appliances from anywhere. This is a cloud alternative
to [replacing wifi module in your AC](https://github.com/GrKoR/esphome_aux_ac_component). This integration will also allow you
to control AUX heat pumps. The implementation of API requests is based on public resources from [Broadlink documentation](https://docs.ibroadlink.com/public/appsdk/sdk_others/dnacontrol/) and reverse engineering.

## Features

- Control AUX air conditioners and heat pumps from Home Assistant
- View device status and sensor readings
- Support for both personal and shared devices
- Secure credential storage (when configured through UI)

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=maeek&repository=ha-aux-cloud&category=integration)
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=aux_cloud)

## HACS Installation (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
2. Go to HACS > Integrations
3. Search for "AUX Cloud"
4. Install the integration
5. Restart Home Assistant

## Manual Installation

1. Download this repository
2. Copy the `custom_components/aux_cloud` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

## UI Configuration (Recommended)

The recommended way to set up this integration is through the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Click the **+ Add Integration** button
3. Search for "AUX Cloud" and select it
4. Enter your AUX Cloud email and password
5. Select your region (e.g., Europe, USA or China - based on your AUX Cloud account)
6. Select which devices you want to add to Home Assistant

  > [!TIP]
  > Make sure that your devices are online when setting up the integration. If you add a device that is offline, it will not add all the entities. You will need to reload the integration manually.

Your credentials will be stored securely in Home Assistant's `.storage/core.config_entries` storage.

## Usage

After setting up the integration, your AUX devices will be available as climate entities in Home Assistant. You can
control them through:

- The Home Assistant UI
- Automations
- Scripts
- Voice assistants integrated with Home Assistant

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Home Assistant logs for error messages
2. Verify your AUX Cloud credentials and selected region is correct
3. Ensure your devices are online and accessible through the AUX Cloud app
4. If you've recently changed your password, you'll need to reconfigure the integration

## Known Issues

- **Logging in the App**: The login process in the app will log out any existing sessions (at least on Android). If you log in the app, reload the integration.

> [!NOTE]
> There are plans to implement automatic relogging if the request fails due to session expiry.

- **Shared devices**: If your account has shared devices, you might encounter an issue that `Platform aux_cloud does not generate unique ids`, check your HA logs and transfer ownership of the device to your account.

## Privacy

This integration communicates with the AUX Cloud servers but stores your credentials locally in Home Assistant's internal storage (when configured through the UI). No data is shared with third parties beyond what's necessary to communicate with AUX Cloud services.
